# CodeClause_SpeedTypingTest
This code creates a GUI window using Tkinter to build a speed typing test. It uses the phrase "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" as the sample text for the user to type. When the "Start" button is clicked, the script shuffles the words, displays them in the GUI, and starts the timer.

The user can start typing in the provided entry field, and when they press Enter or Finish button, the script calculates the accuracy and words per minute (WPM) of the typing. The accuracy is calculated by comparing each word typed by the user with the corresponding word in the original text. The WPM is calculated based on the number of words typed and the time elapsed.

The accuracy and WPM are displayed in the GUI. The user can click the "Start" button again to start a new typing test.

Note that this is a basic example and doesn't include advanced features like backspacing, error highlighting, or word suggestions. Those features can be added based on specific requirements and complexity.
